# Proxy-Server
A proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, available from a different server. The proxy provides the resource by connecting to the relevant server and requesting the service on behalf of the client. It also caches responses from the remote server, and returns subsequent requests for the same content directly.
